# Multi Class Classification
## Problem Statement

Given a dataset of TV Series data, build a machine learning model that can predict the probability that any given TV Series belongs to any of the pre defined genres

## Note

1. The dataset is in CSV format, with first row being the header. Header should be self explanatory, but please ask questions if in doubt.
2. `wikidata_genre_labels` contains the labels (independent variable)
3. Each record can have multiple labels. This is a multi class classification problem.


## Submission

Develop your solution in a Jupyter notebook and send a html version of the notebook by email.
